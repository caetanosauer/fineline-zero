/* A bitmap allocator.

   This class tracks the bookkeeping of chip allocation while leaving
   the corresponding memory management to someone else. The
   implementation requires that chip allocation be single-threaded
   (presumably by some owner thread), but is thread-safe with respect
   to deallocation.

   A given "chip" may be in one of three states:

       USABLE: available to be allocated

       IN-USE: allocated but not yet freed

       ZOMBIE: freed more recently than the last recycling pass

   Allocation is double-buffered in a sense: at the beginning of each
   allocation round, the owning thread unions the current set of
   zombie chips into the usable set; in-use chips are ignored.

   The class has two members to support higher-level functionality:

       _owner: an opaque pointer which is used to verify that blocks
           are being released properly

       _next: an embedded linked list node for use by the owner and
           otherwise ignored by the implementation

/* Control structure for one block of allocatable memory.

   The memory is assumed to be /block_size/ bytes long and must be
   aligned on a /block_size/-sized boundary. The implementation
   exploits the block's alignment to compute the block control for
   pointers being released, meaning there is no per-chip space
   overhead.

   One caveat of the implicit control block pointer approach is that
   the caller is responsible to ensure that any chip passed to
   /release()/ is actually part of a block (presumably by verifying
   that the address range is inside an appropriate memory pool).

   This class manages memory only very loosely: distributing and
   accepting the return of /chip_size/-sized chips. At no time does it
   access any of the memory it manages.
