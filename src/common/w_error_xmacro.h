 * To add new errors, append a new line at the end.
 * You can also insert at an arbitrary place, but note that the value of existing
 * error codes will change in that case.  If we store error codes somewhere, it
 * might become an issue.  For now we don't do that anywhere, though.
 * For more details, see w_error.h.
