 * \brief A cursor object to sequentially read BTree.
 * \details
 * This class is used as follows.
 * \verbatim
    // constructs a cursor with search conditions.
    bt_cursor_t cursor (volid, storeid,
        lower_bound, lower_inclusive,
        upper_bound, upper_inclusive,
        is_forward_direction);
    do {
        W_DO(cursor.next());

 *
 * \section LSN-and-Concurrency
 * A cursor object releases latches on the page
 * after each next() call to allow concurrent accesses.
 * Thus, it also checks if the current page has been
 * changed after its last access using \e _lsn variable.
 *
 * If it has been changed, and if the page still contains
 * the key we previously read, we just re-locate \e _slot
 * in the page and goes on.
 *
 * If it has been changed and also the page doesn't contain
 * the key we previously read any more, we re-locate \e _pid
 * by re-traversing the tree.
 *
 * These two events are expensive,
 * but happen only after the LSN check, so they are rare too.
 *
 * \section Locking-and-Concurrency
 * A cursor object also takes locks on the keys and their
 * intervals it read. Here, the complication is that
 * the cursor object has two modes; \e forward and \e backward.
 * Unfortunately, these two are not quite symmetric because
 * the key range locks are on half-open interval (a key
 * and open interval on its _right_).
 *
 * Also, there's a trade-off between concurrency and overhead.
 * In this class, we try to minimize overhead rather than
 * concurrency. See jira ticket:89 "Cursor case: overhead-concurrency trade-off" (originally trac ticket:91) for more details.
