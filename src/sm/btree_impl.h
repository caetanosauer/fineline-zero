/**
 * \brief The internal implementation class which actually implements the
 * functions of btree_m.
 *
 * \ingroup SSMBTREE
 * \details
 * To abstract implementation details,
 * all functions of this class should be used only from btree_m except testcases.
 *
 * Like btree_m, this class is stateless, meaning all functions are
 * static and there are no class properties. Each function receives
 * the page(s) to work on and has no global side-effect.
 *
 * \section TRANSACTIONS User and System Transactions
 * The functions of this class fall into two categories.
 *
 * 1. (func name starts with \e "_ux_") functions that can be used
 * both in user and system transactions.  Such a function should
 * have only a local change and local latch.
 *
 * 2. (func name starts with \e "_sx_") functions that starts a nested
 * system transactions in it. Such a function can affect
 * the structure of BTree.
 *
 * User transactions do \e both \e logical and \e physical changes
 * and should do \e only \e local physical changes.
 *
 * System transactions do \e only \e physical changes. They sometimes
 * do \e global \e physical changes like page splitting and key-adopts.
 * They should be kept short-lived.
