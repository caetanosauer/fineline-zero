 * \brief Handle class for pages that may be fixed (i.e., paged in by the main buffer
 * manager, bf_tree_m)
 *
 * \details
 * Currently, only B-tree pages are fixable.
 *
 * Pages fixed using latching mode Q for the page being fixed are still subject to
 * modification by other threads at any time, including replacement by a different page;
 * the methods of this class are safe to use in this case (but may return errors such as
 * eLATCHQFAIL) but super or subclass methods may not be safe to use in this case unless
 * their description specifically says so or they are labeled "robust".
