/**

 * \details
 *     All page data types (e.g., generic_page, alloc_page,
 * btree_page, stnode_page) inherit (indirectly) from this class.
 * This is a POD.
 *
 *     The checksum field is placed first to make the region of data
 * it covers continuous.  The order of the other fields has been
 * arranged to maximize packing into the fewest number of words
 * possible.
 *
 *     Because this class contains an 8-byte aligned object (lsn_t),
 * it must be a multiple of eight bytes.  The extra space not needed
 * for all pages (field reserved) is reserved for subclass usage.
 *
 *     Some page types (alloc_page, stnode_page) do not currently
 * (9/2013) use the lsn, reserved, or page_flags fields.

 * associated page class btree_page and handle class btree_page_h.
