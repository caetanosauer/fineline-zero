/** \brief Parses log records from a stream of binary data.
 *
 * This class is not a scanner per se, as it does not perform any I/O.
 * However, it enables efficient scanning by reading whole blocks of binary
 * data from the recovery log and parsing log records from them using this
 * class. This is an improvement over the traditional "scan" implemented in
 * Shore-MT, which performs one random read for each log record.  The major
 * task implemented in this class is the control of block boundaries, which can
 * occur in the middle of a log record (i.e., log records may spawn multiple
 * blocks). To that end, it maintains an internal log record buffer to
 * reconstruct such log records.
 *
 * Log records are delivered via the nextLogrec() method, which takes the block
 * address and offset within the block as parameters. Once the log record is
 * parsed, the offset is updated (i.e., it is an output parameter). The method
 * returns true if the log record was found entirely in the current block.
 * Otherwise, it saves the partial data into its internal buffer and returns
 * false, indicating to the caller that a new block must be provided. Upon
 * invoking nextLogrec() once again, the caller then receives the complete log
 * record.

/** \brief Object to control execution of background threads.
 *
 * Encapsulates an activation loop that relies on pthread condition variables.
 * The background thread calls waitForActivation() while it waits for an
 * activation from an orchestrating thread. Before calling this method,
 * however, it must acquire the mutex, in order to obey the pthread wait
 * protocol.  Once its work is complete, the activated state is unsed and the
 * mutex must be released. In practice, therefore, waitForActivation() is
 * usually invoked as follows.
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
    while (true) {
        CRITICAL_SECTION(cs, control.mutex);
        bool activated = control.waitForActivation();
        if (!activated) {
            break;
        }

        // do work...

    } // mutex released due to CRITICAL_SECTION macro
 * \endcode
 *
 * The wait for an activation is interrupted either by receiving a signal or by
 * setting a shutdown flag, in which case the method returns false. The flag is
 * simply a pointer to some external boolean variable, which means that the
 * background thread "watches for" a shutdown flag somewhere else. The
 * orchestrating thread calls activate() to wake up the background thread,
 * causing the waitForActivation() call to return with true.  The wait
 * parameter makes the activation wait to acquire the mutex, which guarantees
 * that the signal was sent. Otherwise, if the mutex is already held (i.e.,
 * background thread is already running) the method returns false immediately.
 *
 * Optionally, the activate method accepts an lsn, which is stored in endLSN,
 * but only if it is greater than the currently set value. This class does not
 * interpret this LSN value. It is only used by the background thread itself
 * as a marker for the end of its job. This is useful for threads that consume
 * its owrk units from the log, such as LogArchiver or ReaderThread. Other
 * thread classes may completely ignore this variable.
