/**
 * \brief This class is a strawman implementation of tracking the oldest active transaction
 * in the system.
 * \ingroup SSMLOG
 * \details
 * It simply maintains an array of lsndata_t, hash-indexed by _pointer value_ of xct_t so that
 * we can put and remove the _curr_lsn as of the transaction enters.
 * This is a so simple hashmap. We don't even have next pointers in the bucket to avoid
 * synchronization. If the bucket is unluckily already taken, we just spin until the
 * other transaction finishes.
 * In most cases, this causes only one atomic operation for each transaction.
 * Retrieving the low water mark takes time because it has to read all entries, but
 * this class can be used as a delayed proxy. Use get_oldest_active_lsn_cache() in that case.
