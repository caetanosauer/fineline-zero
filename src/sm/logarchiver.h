/** \brief Heap data structure that supports log archive run generation
 *
 * This class encapsulates a heap data structure in a way which is
 * transparent to the replacement-selection logic of the enclosing
 * LogArchiver instance. It contains a heap data structure as well as a
 * memory manager for the variable-length log records.
 *
 * The heap contains instances of HeapEntry, which contains the sort key of
 * log records (run number, page id, lsn) and a pointer to the log record
 * data in the memory manager workspace (slot_t).
 *
 * This class is more than just a heap data structure because it is aware
 * of run boundaries.  Therefore, it can be seen as a replacement-selection
 * module, with the particularity that records are not delayed to future
 * runs, in order to maintain a fixed mapping from regions of the recovery
 * log (i.e., LSN ranges) to runs in the log archive. The goal of such
 * mapping is to facilitate the resume of log archiving after a system
 * failure (see our BTW 2015 paper on Single-Pass Restore for more
 * details).
 *
 * This class participates in the log archiving pipeline in which the input
 * stream of log records coming from the log consumer is fed into the heap
 * by invoking push() for each log record. This is analogous to the
 * replacement step of the sorting algorithm. On the other side, the
 * selection step pops log records out of the heap and feeds them to the
 * BlockAssembly component.

 * In a proper implementation, we have to support useful policies, with the

 * its control logic -- especially the coordination with the WriterThread
 * -- is quite restricted to the usual case of a consumption of log records
 * from the standard recovery log, i.e., ascending LSNs and run numbers,
 * startLSN coming from the existing run files, etc. We have to make that
 * logic clever and more abstract; or simply don't reuse the BlockAssembly
 * infrastructure.

/** \brief Implementation of a log archiver using asynchronous reader and
 * writer threads.
 *
 * The log archiver runs as a background daemon whose execution is controlled
 * by an ArchiverControl object. Once a log archiver thread is created and
 * forked, it waits for an activation to start working. The caller thread must
 * invoke the activate() method to perform this activation.
 *
 * Log archiving works in <b>activation cycles</b>, in which it first waits for
 * an activation and then consumes the recovery log up to a given LSN value
 * (\see activate(bool, lsn_t)).  This cycle is executed in an infinite loop
 * until the method shutdown() is invoked.  Once shutdown is invoked, the
 * current cycle is <b>not</b> interrupted. Instead, it finishes consuming the
 * log until the LSN given in the last successful activation and only then it
 * exits. The destructor also invokes shutdown() if not done yet.
 *
 * The class LogArchiver itself serves merely as an orchestrator of its
 * components, which are:
 * - LogArchiver::LogConsumer, which encapsulates a reader thread and parsing
 *   individual log records from the recovery log.
 * - LogArchiver::ArchiverHeap, which performs run generation by sorting the
 *   input stream given by the log consumer.
 * - LogArchiver::BlockAssembly, which consumes the sorted output from the
 *   heap, builds indexed blocks of log records (used for instant restore), and
 *   passes them over to the asynchronous writer thread
 * - LogArchiver::ArchiveDirectory, which represents the set of sorted runs
 *   that compose the log archive itself. It manages filesystem operations to
 *   read from and write to the log archive, controls access to the archive
 *   index, and provides scanning facilities used by restore.
 *
 * One activation cycle consists of consuming all log records from the log
 * consumer, which must first be opened with the given "end LSN". Each log
 * record is then inserted into the heap until it becomes full. Then, log
 * records are removed from the heap (usually in bulk, e.g., one block at a
 * time) and passed to the block assembly component. The cycle finishes once
 * all log records up to the given LSN are <b>inserted into the heap</b>, which
 * does not necessarily mean that the persistent log archive will contain all
 * those log records. The only way to enforce that is to perform a shutdown.
 * This design maintains the heap always as full as possible, which generates
 * runs whose size is (i) as large as possible and (ii) independent of the
 * activation behavior.
 *
 * In the typical operation mode, a LogArchiver instance is constructed using
 * the sm_options provided by the user, but for tests and external experiments,
 * it can also be constructed by passing instances of these four components
 * above.
 *
 * A note on processing older log partitions (TODO): Before we implemented the
 * archiver, the log manager would delete a partition once it was eliminated
 * from the list of 8 open partitions. The compiler flag KEEP_LOG_PARTITIONS
 * was used to omit the delete operation, leaving the complete history of the
 * database in the log directory. However, if log archiving is enabled, it
 * should take over the responsibility of deleting old log partitions.
 * Currently, if the flag is not set and the archiver cannot keep up with the
 * growth of the log, partitions would be lost from archiving.
