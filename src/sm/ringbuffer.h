/**
 * Simple implementation of a circular IO buffer for the archiver reader,
 * which reads log records from the recovery log, and the archiver writer,
 * which writes sorted runs to output files. Despite being designed for
 * log archiving, it should support more general use cases.
 *
 * The buffer supports only one consumer and one producer, which makes
 * synchronization much simpler. In the case of a read buffer, the producer
 * is the reader thread and the consumer is the sorting thread (with the
 * log scanner), which inserts log records into the heap for replacement
 * selection. In a write buffer, the producer is the sorting thread, while
 * the consumer writes blocks to the current run.
 *
 * The allocation of buffer blocks (by both producers and consumers)
 * must be done in two stages:
 * 1) Request a block, waiting on a condvar if buffer is empty/full
 * 2) Once done, release it to the other producer/consumer thread
 *
 * Requests could be implemented in a single step if we copy
 * the block to the caller's memory, but we want to avoid that.
 * Again, this assumes that only one thread is consuming and one is
 * releasing, and that they request and release blocks in an ordered
 * behavior.
