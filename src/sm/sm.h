/**\addtogroup SSMXCT
 * All storage manager operations on data must be done within the scope of
 * a transaction (ss_m::begin_xct, ss_m::commit_xct, ss_m::abort_xct,
 * ss_m::chain_xct).
 *
 * A very few storage manager operations, such as formatting a volume, are
 * called outside the scope of a transaction and the storage manager begins
 * its own transaction to do the work.
 *
 * Operations that fail return an error indication and the storage
 * manager assumes that the server will thereafter abort the
 * transaction in which the error occurred, when abort is indicated.
 * Abort is indicated when eUSERABORT or eDEADLOCK is returned and
 * when the erver chooses to abort rather than to work around the problem
 * (whatever it might be, such as eRETRY).
 *
 * The storage manager does not enforce the aborting of any erroneous
 * transactions except, possibly, those that are in danger of
 * running out of log space.
 * (This is done with the destructor of the prologue used on each call
 * to the storage manager, see next paragraph).
 *
 * It is always the server's responsibility to abort.
 * When the storage manager
 * encounters a eLOGSPACEWARN condition (the log hasn't enough
 * space \e at \e this \e moment to abort the running transaction,
 * assuming a 1:1 ration of rollback-logging overhead to forward-processing
 * logging overhead), it does one of two things:
 * - passes the error code eLOGSPACEWARN up the call stack back to the server
 *   if the storage manager was constructed with no log-space-warning callback
 *   argument (see LOG_WARN_CALLBACK_FUNC, ss_m::ss_m).
 * - tries to abort a transaction before passing an error code back up
 *   the call stack to the server. Choosing a victim transaction to abort
 *   is done by the server in its log-space-warning callback function (passed
 *   in on ss_m::ss_m, q.v.
 *   Only if that callback function returns a non-null victim transaction
 *   and returns eUSERABORT does the storage manager abort that victim
 *   before returning eUSERABORT up the call stack. Any other
 *   error code returned by the callback function is just returned up
 *   the call stack.
 *
 * \section LOCKS Locks
 *
 * The storage manager automatically acquires the
 * necessary locks when the data are read or written.
 * The locks thus acquired are normally released at the end of a transaction,
 * thus, by default, transactions are two-phase and well-formed (degree 3).
 *
 * \section DISTXCT Distributed Transactions
 * Storage manager transactions may be used as "threads" (to
 * overload this term) of distributed transactions.
 * Coordination of 2-phase commit must be done externally,
 * but the storage manager supports preparing the (local) transaction "thread"
 * for two-phase commit, and it will log the necessary
 * data for recovering in-doubt transactions.
 *
 * \section ATTACH Threads and Transactions
 * Transactions are not tied to storage manager threads (smthread_t, not
 * to be confused with a local "thread" of a distributed transaction) in any
 * way other than that a transaction must be \e attached to a
 * thread while any storage manager work is being done on behalf of
 * that transaction.   This is how the storage manager knows \e which
 * transaction is to acquire the locks and latches, etc.
 * But a thread can attach and detach from transactions at will, so
 * work may be performed by different threads each time the storage
 * manager is called on behalf of a given transaction; this allows the
 * server to keep a pool of threads to perform work and allows them to
 * perform work on behalf of any active transaction.
 *
 * \warning
 * While there are limited circumstances in which multiple threads can be
 * attached to the same transaction \e concurrently and perform storage
 * manager operations on behalf of that transaction concurrently,
 * which is a hold-over from the original storage manager, this
 * functionality will be deprecated soon.  The reason for this being
 * removed is that it is extremely difficult to handle errors internally
 * when multiple threads are attached to a transaction because
 * partial rollback is impossible in the absence of multiple log streams
 * for a transaction.
 *
 * Under no circumstances may a thread attach to more than one transaction
 * at a time.
 *
 *
 * \section EXOTICA Exotica
 * The storage manager also provides
 * - partial rollback (ss_m::save_work and ss_m::rollback_work),
 *   which undoes actions but does not release locks,
 * - transaction chaining (ss_m::chain_xct), which commits, but retains locks
 *   and gives them to a new transaction,
 * - lock release (ss_m::unlock), allowing less-than-3-degree
 *   transactions.
 *
 *  To reduce the cost (particularly in logging) of loading databases,
 *  the storage manager provides for unlogged loading of stores.
 *  See \ref SSMSTORE.
