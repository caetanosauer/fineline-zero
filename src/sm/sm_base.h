     * \ingroup SSMSTORE
     * \details
     * - t_regular: All pages in the store are fully logged for ACID properties.
     * - t_temporary: Structural changes to the store are guaranteed by
     *             logging but user data are not.   In the case of indexes,
     *             the ihtegrity of the index is not guaranteed: only the
     *             integrity of the store is guaranteed. In the event of
     *             abort, the index must be destroyed.
     *             Temporary stores are destroyed when a volume is mounted or
     *             dismounted, so they do not survive restart, regardless
     *             whether a crash occurred.
     * - t_load_file: A store that is created with this property starts out
     *             as a t_tempory store and is converted to a t_regular
     *             store upon commit.
     * - t_insert_file: Updates to existing pages are fully logged (as if the
     *             store were t_regular), but pages allocated while the
     *             store has t_insert_file are not logged. This is useful for
     *             bulk-loading, e.g., a store is bulk-loaded in one
     *             transaction (t_load_file), which commits (now the file is
     *             t_regular); subsequent appends to the file would incur
     *             full logging, so the subsequent transaction can change the
     *             store's property to t_insert_file, append the data,
     *             and change the store's property back to t_regular.
