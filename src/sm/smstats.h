/**\addtogroup SSMSTATS
 *
 * The storage manager API allows a server to gather statistics on
 * a per-transaction basis or on a global basis.
 * These counters are not segregated by the semantics of the counters. Rather,
 * they are segregated by the thread that performed the action being measured.
 * In other words, an action is attributed to a transaction if it was
 * performed by a thread while attached to that transaction.
 * This means that some actions, such as writing pages to disk, might not
 * be attributable to a transaction even though they are in some
 * sense logically
 * associated with that transaction.  If the write is performed by a
 * page writer (background thread), it will show up in the global statistics
 * but not in any per-transaction statistics. On the other hand, if a write
 * is performed by ss_m::set_store_property (which flushes to disk
 * all pages for the store thus changed) it will be attributed to the
 * transaction.
 *
 * All statistics are collected on a per-smthread_t basis
 * (thus avoiding expensive atomic updates on a per-counter basis).
 * Each smthread has its own
 * local sm_stats_info_t structure for these statistics.
 * Any time this structure is cleared,
 * its contents are added to a single global statistics structure
 * (protected by a mutex) before it is cleared.
 * The clearing happens in two circumstances:
 * - when an smthread_t is destroyed (in its destructor)
 * - when an attached instrumented transaction collects the statistics from
 *   the thread (see below).
 *
 * Thus, the single global statistics structure's contents reflect the
 * activities of finished threads and of instrumented transactions' collected
 * statistics, and all other activities are reflected in per-thread
 * statistics structures.
 *
 * A value-added server may collect the global statistics with the
 * ss_m::gather_stats method.  This method first adds together all the
 * per-thread statistics, adds in the global statistics, and returns.
 * The global statistics cannot be reset, and, indeed, they survive
 * the storage manager so that they can be gathered after the
 * storage manager shuts down. This means that to determine incremental
 * statistics, the value-added server has to keep the prior copy of
 * statistics and diff the current statistics from the prior statistics.
 * The sm_stats_info_t has a difference operator to make this easy.
 * \attention Gathering the per-thread statistics from running threads is
 * not atomic; in other words, if threads are updating their counters
 * while the gathering of their counters is going on, some counts may
 * be missed (become stale). (In any case, they will be stale soon
 * after the statistics are gathered.)
 *
 * A transaction must be instrumented to collect its statistics.
 *
 * Instrumenting a transaction
 * consists in allocating a structure in which to store the collected
 * statistics, and passing in that structure to the storage manager using
 * using the variants of begin_xct, commit_xct, etc that take
 * an argument of this type.
 *
 * When a transaction is detached from a thread,
 * the statistics it gathered up to that point by the thread are
 * added to the per-transaction statistics, and the thread statistics are
 * cleared so they don't get over-counted.
 *
 * A server may gather the per-transaction statistics for the
 * attached running transaction with
 * ss_m::gather_xct_stats.
 *
 * A server may choose to reset the per-transaction statistics when it
 * gathers them; this facilitates gathering incremental statistics.
 * These counters aren't lost to the world, since their values were
 * added to the global statistics before they were gathered in the first place.
 *
 * \attention The per-transaction statistics structure is not
 * protected against concurrently-attached threads, so
 * its values are best collected and reset when the server
 * knows that only one thread is attached to the
 * transaction when making the call.
